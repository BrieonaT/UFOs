## Overview
Dana, a data journalist,  gets the chance to write about whatever she pleases. She chooses her home town of McMinnville, Oregon, not only to revisit her childhood, but to write about UFOs, which the town is known for. She wanted to be able to display the data in a HTML webpage, complete with a small article and a table displaying UFO data. After the initial webpage was built, she decided she wanted a more indepth filtering of the data in the table, including searching for specific cities, states, countries and shapes of the UFOs. In this repository is the completion of that task.

## Results
The usage of the webpage now that it’s fully complete is pretty simple. As it stands now, once you download the repository, drag the HTML file into the browser. There, you will be met with the site.

On the left side, you will notice a variety of fields to fill in (date, city, state, country, shape). From here, you can fill in one or all of the fields. You do not have to fill in every field given, just the ones desired. For example, if you wanted to find UFO sightings in Oregon that were in the shape of a triangle, you’d just fill in the shape and state forms and hit enter.  If you want to clear your filters, simply just erase the filters you entered and hit enter again, or if you want new filters, enter those and hit enter again.

## Summary
As it currently stands, the site functions and serves its purpose. However, there are some drawbacks and there is always room for improvement in its current design. A drawback right now is the input field. As it stands, it’s a little cumbersome to clear the filters, in which you have to either clear every field or refresh the page. It’d be more user-friendly to have a clear button close to the fields at which you enter the information filters than to do either of those.
As stated before, the current site has room for improvement. One way it could be improved is have a more intuitive setup when it comes to input into the current fields. As it stands now, you can only enter things in a lowercase format (i.e., ar not AR for Arkansas). I think adding the possibility of doing a range of dates would be a cool and useful feature, instead of having to enter a date and then clear, and do that process over again for every date you want to see.
